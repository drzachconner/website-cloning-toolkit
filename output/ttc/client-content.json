      "bio": "Dr. Marvin Talsky — known to the chiropractic world as \"Papa Marv\" — graduated from Palmer College of Chiropractic in 1963 and has dedicated over six decades to advancing the art and science of chiropractic. In 1995, he co-founded Torque Release Technique (TRT) alongside Dr. Jay Holder, helping to establish one of the most widely taught tonal techniques in the profession. Building on that foundation, Papa Marv created Talsky Tonal Chiropractic (TTC) in 2001, a paradigm shift that goes beyond technique to engage the nervous system in a much more direct way. Through seminars, online modules, papers, and books, Papa Marv continues to train chiropractors worldwide in tonal principles and their application. His teaching integrates quantum physics principles and consciousness into the chiropractic adjustment, guiding practitioners from a mechanistic approach to one rooted in tonal awareness.",
